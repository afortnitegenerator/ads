      "description": "In this map you spawn on a island infected by a zombie plague. Your main goal is to survive and survive you will. There are different parts of the map like a broken town, a forest, and a base. Throughout these areas there can be loot stashed away in which you can find. The island is isolated so leaving it will not help your cause. Your best means of survival is to take what you can find and make it last. Just watch out for the undead and don't starve! Later the island will be updated and likely expanded on! If you liked this map and want more subscribe to my YouTube Channel and join my Discord Server. I make maps, tutorials, and more!"
